        Animal is a 2023 Indian Hindi-language action drama film[1][6] co-written, directed and edited by Sandeep Reddy
        Vanga and produced by T-Series Films, Bhadrakali Pictures and Cine1 Studios. The film stars Ranbir Kapoor, Anil
        Kapoor, Bobby Deol, Rashmika Mandanna and Triptii Dimri. The film follows Ranvijay "Vijay" Singh, the son of a
        powerful industrialist, and his troubled relationship with his father, which gets further jeopardized as he
        undergoes a brutal transformation and sets out on a path of vengeance and destruction after an assassination
        attempt on his father.

        The film was officially announced in January 2021. Principal photography began in April 2022 and wrapped by
        April 2023, with cinematography by Amit Roy. The film's soundtrack album was composed by Pritam, JAM8, Vishal
        Mishra, Jaani, Manan Bhardwaj, Shreyas Puranik, Ashim Kemson and Harshavardhan Rameshwar. With a runtime of 201
        minutes, Animal is one of the longest Indian films ever made. It was initially set for an August 2023 release
        but was postponed due to post-production work.[7]

        Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves, characterised by feathers, toothless
        beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet
        lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8
        m (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. There are over 11,000 living species and they are split into 44 orders. More than
        half are passerine or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only
        known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are modified forelimbs, gave
        birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including
        ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also
        uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some
        waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming. The study of birds is called ornithology.

        Birds are feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods, and constitute the only known living
        dinosaurs. Likewise, birds are considered reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and their closest
        living relatives are the crocodilians. Birds are descendants of the primitive avialans (whose members include
        Archaeopteryx) which first appeared during the Late Jurassic. According to some estimates, modern birds
        (Neornithes) evolved in the Late Cretaceous or between the Early and Late Cretaceous (100 Ma) and diversified
        dramatically around the time of the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago, which killed off
        the pterosaurs and all non-ornithuran dinosaurs.[4][5]
